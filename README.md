## 01 Runspaces
Runspaces are a way to perform fast parallel processing with powershell. They are much faster then synchronus processing and even faster then jobs. Runspaces work very well for system management running against long lists of target systems. 

Also, take a look at [this article](https://learn-powershell.net/2012/05/13/using-background-runspaces-instead-of-psjobs-for-better-performance/) in regards to speed vs jobs or synchronous procsessing.
